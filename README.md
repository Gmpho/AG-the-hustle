System Design 🚀
🎨 Frontend UI (Loveable AI) – A React/Next.js web app with a chat interface. It’s the user-facing “Loveable AI” portal for interaction. The UI captures user prompts and displays agent responses, providing a friendly and interactive experience. It runs as a static/SSR web service connecting to backend APIs.
🔗 API Gateway – A managed gateway (e.g. Google API Gateway or Cloud Endpoints) that routes requests securely. It fronts the backend, handles authentication, rate-limiting, and CORS. All client calls go through the gateway, which then invokes the proper services (agent logic, tools, DB queries).
🧠 Agent Layer (Claude + MCPs) – The core LLM-driven logic. We use Anthropic’s Claude (or similar LLM) as the “brain” to interpret user intent and orchestrate tasks. Model Context Protocols (MCPs) guide how we frame prompts and context for the model
cobusgreyling.medium.com
. In other words, well-defined prompt templates and context windows ensure the agent stays on task. This layer loops over the LLM until a final answer or action is reached

.


🛠️ Tooling Layer (n8n, Notion API, Supabase) – External helpers that extend the agent’s capabilities. For example, n8n (an open-source workflow engine) automates data pipelines and triggers; the Notion API provides a knowledge base or task store; Supabase (managed Postgres + auth) stores state or logs. Each tool is exposed via APIs that the agent can call. Tools extend the agent’s capabilities by using APIs from underlying systems
file-fmyed7e2gscky4wedqgdb4
. Designing each tool as a clear, reusable function (with well-documented inputs/outputs) makes the system modular and testable
file-fmyed7e2gscky4wedqgdb4
.

🧩 Vector DBs – Fast similarity search for contextual memory or documents. We store embeddings of user data or docs (e.g. from Notion or research sources) in a vector database (like Pinecone, PGVector, or Supabase’s vector extension). When the agent needs context (RAG-style), it queries this DB to find relevant info. This enables the agent to retrieve long-term memory or knowledge without hard-coding it into prompts.

🔄 CI/CD (Docker + Cloud Build) – Development and deployment automation. Every service (UI and backend) is containerized with Docker. Cloud Build is used to build Docker images and run tests; it’s free up to 120 build-minutes/day

cloud.google.com
. After a successful build, images are pushed to Artifact Registry. A Cloud Build trigger or GitHub Action then deploys containers to Cloud Run. This pipeline ensures consistent deployments and easy rollbacks.
☁️ Serverless Deployment (Cloud Run) – All components run as stateless Docker containers on Cloud Run, Google’s managed serverless platform. Cloud Run automatically scales each service up and down based on load. We configure each service to use minimal memory/CPU (e.g. 256-512MB, 1 CPU) so that most usage stays within the free tier. Cloud Run’s per-request billing (only charge for CPU/GB-seconds when handling requests) means idle costs are $0, fitting perfectly with a microservices approach. Serverless ensures zero ops and leverages Google’s always-free tier for generous monthly usage

15 SaaS Projects 💼
Loveable FAQ Bot – A customer FAQ chatbot. It uses Notion (or Supabase) as a content store and an LLM to answer questions. Packaged in a Docker container (Node.js/Express), deployed to Cloud Run. It only handles simple Q&A requests, so usage is light. Cloud Build (120 free min/day
cloud.google.com
) handles CI, and Cloud Run’s 2M free requests/mo

 cover typical traffic.
 
Smart Scheduler – An appointment scheduler powered by AI. It connects to Google Calendar (via API) and NLP to interpret scheduling requests. Implemented in Python (Flask) and containerized for Cloud Run. Uses only a few vCPU-seconds per request and sleeps otherwise, keeping compute minimal. Because it’s event-driven and low-volume, it stays within free-tier quotas.

Meeting Summarizer – Takes meeting notes (audio or transcript) and returns key summaries and action items. Uses a transcription API and LLM. Containerized (e.g. FastAPI) with background jobs (Cloud Run Jobs or Cloud Tasks). Because heavy compute (audio processing) is infrequent, most runs use small bursts of CPU which remain in free-tier.

Support Ticket Automator – Email/slack bot that triages support tickets. It uses LLMs to classify issues and draft replies. Built as a service using SendGrid/Gmail APIs, running on Cloud Run. Low concurrency and message volume means it fits under the free limits easily.

Blog Idea Generator – Web service that suggests blog topics from keywords or trends. Uses an LLM prompt to brainstorm ideas. Packaged in Docker and deployed to Cloud Run via Cloud Build. Typically one request per user session, so 2M/month free requests cover many active users.

Personal CRM Agent – A contact manager that schedules follow-ups. It stores contacts in Supabase and sends reminders via email. Uses an LLM to suggest follow-up text. Deployed as a REST API container on Cloud Run. Supabase free tier (10K API calls) and light compute fit well in free limits.

Invoice Assistant – Generates invoices from client data. User uploads a template, and the service fills it via an LLM and emails it. Uses Supabase or Cloud Storage for file hosting. Running as a container on Cloud Run, it only spins up when needed (on demand). Storage and outbound emails are within free limits for small-scale use.

Inventory Alert Bot – Tracks product inventory in Supabase and notifies admins when low stock. Built with n8n workflows that trigger LLMs for recommendations. The n8n server (container) and the agent run on Cloud Run. With infrequent triggers and simple logic, it easily stays within free CPU/Gb usage.

Sentiment API Service – A web API that returns sentiment analysis for text. Wraps an LLM or a smaller model in a container, deployed to Cloud Run. Stateless and fast (only text input/output), it processes thousands of calls well under the free request quota
cloud.google.com
.
Travel Planner Bot – Helps plan trips using destination info. It calls external APIs (Maps/Weather) and an LLM to create itineraries. The service is packaged in Docker (Go or Python) and deployed on Cloud Run. External API usage is minimal; compute time per request is short, making it suitable for free-tier usage.

Recipe Recommendation Chat – A chatbot that suggests recipes from given ingredients. It leverages a recipe database (Supabase) and LLM for creative combos. Runs on Cloud Run container. Because queries are quick and rarely concurrent, the agent rarely exceeds the free compute seconds.

Language Tutor AI – Interactive language practice bot. It uses a vector DB of vocab or phrases and an LLM for quizzes. Deployed as a web service in a container. Each user session makes a few light calls; with Cloud Run’s auto-scaling to zero, this stays in free-tier.

Code Review Assistant – Reviews code via GitHub API. The agent fetches a PR diff, sends to an LLM for feedback. Packaged in a container and triggered via webhook (Cloud Run). Because reviews are on-demand and brief, CPU usage per run is small, fitting the free-tier profile.

Weather Alert Service – Notifies users of severe weather via SMS/email. It uses a weather API and a simple LLM to summarize alerts. Running as a container, it mostly sleeps and only wakes on schedule or event—this low-duty cycle costs almost nothing.

Task Automation Bot – Automates daily tasks (e.g. email sorting) using custom rules + LLMs. Deployed on Cloud Run with triggers (Cloud Scheduler). Light background jobs keep it within Cloud Build’s free builds and Cloud Run’s free exec time.

Cloud Cost Summary 💸

🆓 Free Credits: Google Cloud offers new users $300 credit for 90 days
cloud.google.com
, which can cover prototype workloads (AI calls, storage, network) beyond the free tier.
☁️ Always Free Tier: Many components run within Google’s always-free quotas: Cloud Run provides 2 million free requests per month, plus free vCPU/RAM-seconds (180K vCPU-seconds, 360K GiB-seconds)

. Cloud Build gives 120 build-minutes per day for free

. Combined, these allow continuous deployment and light workloads at zero cost.
 👇👇
💾 Managed Services: We leverage free plans or minimal usage on other platforms (e.g. Supabase’s free DB tier, Notion’s free API usage). n8n can run on its free cloud plan or a small Cloud Run container. This design means typical usage stays well under paid thresholds.
💡 Resource Efficiency: By designing each service to use small containers (e.g. 256–512 MB RAM) and autoscaling to zero, compute costs stay near $0 for idle time. Even CPU-intensive tasks (like LLM calls) occur per-request; with low concurrency, most usage falls into the free-slabs of Cloud Run (and $300 credits if needed). Monitoring usage ensures we remain within budget.
📊 Example: A hypothetical agent handling 50k requests/month with 0.5s latency on 1 vCPU would cost about $3 (request+compute) without free tier. With free tier applied, it’s essentially $0
cloud.google.com
. Thus, this stack can run many small apps concurrently in the free tier.
Appendix: Key Agent-Building Patterns 🛠️
🏁 Single-Agent First: Start with one agent that has all necessary tools and prompts. Incrementally add capabilities to this agent rather than creating multiple agents from the outset. A single well-designed agent “can handle many tasks by incrementally adding tools, keeping complexity manageable”
file-fmyed7e2gscky4wedqgdb4
. This simplifies development and debugging.
🚧 Guardrails: Apply layered safety checks around the agent. Use multiple guardrail mechanisms (rule-based filters, content classifiers, moderation APIs) so that “multiple, specialized guardrails together creates more resilient agents.”
file-fmyed7e2gscky4wedqgdb4
. Guardrails should be explicit functions or micro-agents that validate inputs/outputs against policies, ensuring the agent stays on scope and safe.
🔧 Tools-First Abstraction: Design external functions/APIs (“tools”) as first-class components. Each tool should have a clear, standardized interface. Good practices include thorough testing and reusability
file-fmyed7e2gscky4wedqgdb4
. By treating tools as modular building blocks, you can easily extend the agent’s skills without rewriting core logic.
📝 Structured Prompts: Write clear, step-by-step instructions and templates for the agent. Define each prompt step to correspond to a specific action or outcome
file-fmyed7e2gscky4wedqgdb4
. Use prompt templates with variables for dynamic data to avoid rewriting prompts. Ensure edge cases are handled with explicit branches or conditional instructions
file-fmyed7e2gscky4wedqgdb4
. This structured approach reduces ambiguity and errors in agent reasoning.
